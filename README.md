# mentorlab
MentorLab is a project that stems from the ARA-W Initiative put together to connect hihgly driven women in Africa with scientific research teams at prestigious universities and colleges around the world. The need for an adequate system to log and collate information about partcipants and new applicants to the program stemmed the establishment of a Technology Advancement Team (TAT). The TAT will be responsible for managing informational data on applicants, participants, and collaborators. The data will provide analytical information about the progress and advancements of ARA-W. The TAT has proposed to develo a web app as a platform to manage the afore-mentioned informational data. Via this platform, new applicants will submit an application of interest in the program; accepted applicants will be able to connect with fellow colleagues and potential mentors, who can share more information about their projects and interests; alum participants will provide regular feedback about their current professional development in STEM and academia; mentors will provide information on opportunities in STEM, such as internships, research topics, and ideas; board members will review applications of interests, monitor and moderate users and system data analytics.
MentorLab can possibly be disguised as a professional and acadmeical social network, it will offer the establishment and development of networks between like-minded members of the society from around the world, all in one place.
